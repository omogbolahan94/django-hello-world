<!--
The real power of templates is their ability to be extended. If you think about most websites,
there is content that is repeated on every page (header, footer, etc). Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if we,
as developers, could have one canonical place for our header code that would be inherited by all
other templates?

This base.html file contains a header with links to our two pages (home and about page). 

We can use the built-in url template tag which takes the URL pattern name as an argument
to add URL links in our project.
-->

<header>
    <a href="{% url 'home' %}">Home</a> |
    <a href="{% url 'about' %}">About</a>
</header>

<!-- Blocks can be overwritten by child templates via inheritance. -->
{% block content %}
{% endblock content %}
